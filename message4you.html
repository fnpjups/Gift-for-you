                    Baby we do have individuality, you are waaaaaay more funnier than I can ever be. 
                    Your sense of humor is so unique and it never fails to make me laugh even from when
                    we were just friends. Whenever I think about times where I've laughed so hard, you 
                    are always the reason hehe. You have a way of bringing joy and light into my life 
                    and I cherish every single moment we spend together.

                    Being with you makes me feel so safe and comforted. Your presence is like a warm embrace 
                    that I never want to leave your side. Even when you say you are complicated, I want you to 
                    know that I am here to understand and love every part of you. Your complexities make you 
                    who you are and I love you no matter what.

                    without you. I love you so much, now and always. Mwamwamwa.
